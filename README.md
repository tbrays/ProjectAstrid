“In 2040, there will be more humanoid robot than there are people… autonomy is here.” (FII Institute, 2024)

This project simulates the operation of a humanoid robot, designed for delivery tasks. The robot operates within a predefined environment, navigating a grid-like map to locate and reach destinations. The robot is designed to efficiently plans routes and interacts with its surroundings to successfully complete deliveries.
